# MLAlgos

This repository contains a few of the most common statistical and ML algorithms, as well as additional code that I find useful for processing the data.


 -> classifiers: logistic regression classifier
 
 -> various: contains functions for scaling features, adding the intercept (constant = 1) to a set of data, splitting the dataset to training set, cross-validation set and test-set (or just training set and cross-validation set)
 
 -> image_processing: a vectorized implementation of two useful image processing algorithms: image compression and RGB to grayscale conversion
 


Any comment, suggestion and feedback is welcome.
